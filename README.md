# Decentralizing the CPI

The CPI will be the first use case for the decentralized research system, D-FACTO. 

Governments have an incentive to push the CPI in one direction or another depending on policy objectives.  Conflict of interest coupled with centralization, power, and lack of transparency  lead to tyranny. The underlying data used by governments are inaccessible, hence, the index cannot be openly recreated and fact checked: this is where open networks can radically improve the index!
